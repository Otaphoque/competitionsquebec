Our annual  CyberSci Regional Challenges are a day of hacking in the morning, interviews in the afternoon, and job offers by supper.  (Thatâ€™s for summer, co-op, intern jobs.  Offers for full-time posts usually follow within a few days.)

Join us for the regionals happening on November 23rd in Montreal! (Exact location to be announced soon.)

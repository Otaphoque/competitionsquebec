Our annual  CyberSci Regional Challenges are a day of hacking in the morning, interviews in the afternoon, and job offers by supper.  (Thatâ€™s for summer, co-op, intern jobs.  Offers for full-time posts usually follow within a few days.)

Winners of the local competition move on the nationals in Ottawa, and potentially the international finals!

To participate, ask you school's student association for more details.

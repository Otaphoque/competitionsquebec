NorthSec, the biggest in-person CTF is back!

Our applied security contest (also called "Capture The Flag") opposes 100 teams of 8 people trying to obtain the most points by capturing flags.

Those flags typically are secret messages hidden in different challenges.

The Challenges will be available to teams through a web portal on their own private contest network. Teams are not authorized to attack each other (it's not a red/blue team type of contest). They compete to have the most points on the leaderboard.

2024 will follow our original in-person formula!

Vous pouvez également participer à la conférence, aux ateliers et à d'autres activités. Plus d'informations sur le [site officiel](https://nsec.io/fr/).

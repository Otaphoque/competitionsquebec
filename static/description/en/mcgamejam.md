The coolest GAME JAM 🧑‍💻is back and better than ever -- for our 10th consecutive year 🎉! 

Organized by GameDev McGill, McGame Jam is a 48-HOUR game development marathon 🎮 in which participants are tasked with creating a playable game following a given theme. The primary goal is to collaborate with friends and to create games, no matter the skill level 🙋‍♂️. 

Join us at this year’s special Jam on JANUARY 19th 📅 at the L. M. Trottier Building for a great weekend of learning, teamwork, game development and, of course, fun 👾!

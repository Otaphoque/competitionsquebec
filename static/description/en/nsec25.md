Our applied security contest (also called "Capture The Flag") opposes 75+ teams of 8 people trying to obtain the most points by capturing flags.

Those flags typically are secret messages hidden in different challenges.

The Challenges will be available to teams through a web portal on their own private contest network. Teams are not authorized to attack each other (it's not a red/blue team type of contest). They compete to have the most points on the leaderboard.

2025 will be, to our knowledge, the biggest in-person CTF in the World!

🎮 Hey everyone!
I’ve been brainstorming some incremental game ideas lately, but couldn’t find any short game jams specifically focused on this genre — so I decided to organize one myself! 🍪👀

This will be a chill, low-key jam running for 72 hours from June 13–16, hosted entirely on itch.io.

After the jam, there’ll be a 4-day voting period to rate and play each other’s games!

 🕹️ Join in and let’s build some satisfying number-growing goodness:

Hope to see your game there! 🎮🕹️

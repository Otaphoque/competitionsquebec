# CS Games are back!

The CS Games competition is the largest computer science competition in Quebec every year. Each mid-March, it brings together between twenty and thirty teams of ten undergraduate students from a dozen North-American universities. Their goal? To win the grand CS Cup. To determine the winners, teams compete in challenging competitions covering all areas of computer science: from web and mobile development to artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and more practical fields like robotics, nothing is overlooked.

# ðŸ“‹ About this website

Welcome to [Competitions Quebec](https://competitionsquebec.ca) ! As a student myself, I love to participate in competitions and meet like-minded people, but I sometimes find it hard to find information about them. Whether it is for hackathons, GameJams, CTFs, or other competitions such as CS Games or JDIS Games, I hope this website will serve as a central platform to find such info and share resources. 

We also have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/UYAk93a2ZS) and an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/competitionsqc.ca/)!
